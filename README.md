# extra-lua-functions
This repository is for basic functions that Lua's standard library does not appear to have at the moment. This will probably not be turned into a module for various reasons.

## Use it
To use the functions provided, simply paste [this](/compressed-extra-functions.lua) at the top of your Lua program and you are good to go.
## Extra things
I'll add some basic documentation in a markdown file about the functions included.
